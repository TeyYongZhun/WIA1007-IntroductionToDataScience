       " <p>A simple way to think about AI is as a series of nested or derivative concepts that have emerged over more than 70 years:</p>,\n",
       " <p>Directly underneath AI, we have machine learning, which involves creating <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-model\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">models</a> by training an algorithm to make predictions or decisions based on data. It encompasses a broad range of techniques that enable computers to learn from and make inferences based on data without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.</p>,\n",
       " <p>There are many types of machine learning techniques or algorithms, including <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/linear-regression\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">linear regression</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/logistic-regression\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">logistic regression</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/decision-trees\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">decision trees</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/random-forest\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">random forest</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/support-vector-machine\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">support vector machines</a> <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/support-vector-machine\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">(SVMs)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/knn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">k-nearest neighbor (KNN),</a> <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/clustering\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">clustering</a> and more. Each of these approaches is suited to different kinds of problems and data.</p>,\n",
       " <p>But one of the most popular types of machine learning algorithm is called a <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/neural-networks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">neural network</a> (or artificial neural network). Neural networks are modeled after the human brain's structure and function. A neural network consists of interconnected layers of nodes (analogous to neurons) that work together to process and analyze complex data. Neural networks are well suited to tasks that involve identifying complex patterns and relationships in large amounts of data.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The simplest form of machine learning is called <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/supervised-learning\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">supervised learning</a>, which involves the use of labeled data sets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. In supervised learning, humans pair each training example with an output label. The goal is for the model to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs in the training data, so it can predict the labels of new, unseen data.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multilayered neural networks, called deep neural networks, that more closely simulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Deep neural networks include an input layer, at least three but usually hundreds of hidden layers, and an output layer, unlike neural networks used in classic machine learning models, which usually have only one or two hidden layers.</p>,\n",
       " <p>These multiple layers enable <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/unsupervised-learning\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">unsupervised learning</a>: they can automate the extraction of features from large, unlabeled and unstructured data sets, and make their own predictions about what the data represents.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Because deep learning doesn’t require human intervention, it enables machine learning at a tremendous scale. It is well suited to <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">natural language processing (NLP)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/computer-vision\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">computer vision</a>, and other tasks that involve the fast, accurate identification complex patterns and relationships in large amounts of data. Some form of deep learning powers most of the artificial intelligence (AI) applications in our lives today.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Deep learning also enables:</p>,\n",
       " <p>Generative AI, sometimes called \"gen AI\"<em>, </em>refers to deep learning models that can create complex original content such as long-form text, high-quality images, realistic video or audio and more in response to a user’s prompt or request.</p>,\n",
       " <p>At a high level, generative models encode a simplified representation of their training data, and then draw from that representation to create new work that’s similar, but not identical, to the original data.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Generative models have been used for years in statistics to analyze numerical data. But over the last decade, they evolved to analyze and generate more complex data types. This evolution coincided with the emergence of three sophisticated deep learning model types:</p>,\n",
       " <p>Gain the knowledge to prioritize AI investments that drive business growth. Get started with our free AI Academy today and lead the future of AI in your organization.</p>,\n",
       " <p>In general, generative AI operates in three phases:</p>,\n",
       " <p>Generative AI begins with a \"foundation model\"; a deep learning model that serves as the basis for multiple different types of generative AI applications.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The most common foundation models today are <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">large language models (LLMs)</a>, created for text generation applications. But there are also foundation models for image, video, sound or music generation, and multimodal foundation models that support several kinds of content.</p>,\n",
       " <p>To create a foundation model, practitioners train a deep learning algorithm on huge volumes of relevant raw, unstructured, unlabeled data, such as terabytes or petabytes of data text or images or video from the internet. The training yields a <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/neural-networks?\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">neural network</a> of billions of <em>parameters </em>encoded representations of the entities, patterns and relationships in the data that can generate content autonomously in response to prompts. This is the foundation model.</p>,\n",
       " <p>This training process is compute-intensive, time-consuming and expensive. It requires thousands of clustered graphics processing units (GPUs) and weeks of processing, all of which typically costs millions of dollars. Open source foundation model projects, such as Meta's Llama-2, enable gen AI developers to avoid this step and its costs.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Next, the model must be tuned to a specific content generation task. This can be done in various ways, including:</p>,\n",
       " <p>Developers and users regularly assess the outputs of their generative AI apps, and further tune the model even as often as once a week for greater accuracy or relevance. In contrast, the foundation model itself is updated much less frequently, perhaps every year or 18 months.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Another option for improving a gen AI app's performance is retrieval augmented generation<em> </em>(RAG), a technique for extending the foundation model to use relevant sources outside of the training data to refine the parameters for greater accuracy or relevance.<br/>\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>An <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents\">AI agent</a> is an autonomous AI program, it can perform tasks and accomplish goals on behalf of a user or another system without human intervention, by designing its own workflow and using available tools (other applications or services).</p>,\n",
       " <p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-ai\">Agentic AI</a> is a system of multiple AI agents, the efforts of which are coordinated, or orchestrated, to accomplish a more complex task or a greater goal than any single agent in the system could accomplish.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Unlike chatbots and other AI models which operate within predefined constraints and require human intervention, AI agents and agentic AI exhibit autonomy, goal-driven behavior and adaptability to changing circumstances. The terms “agent” and “agentic” refer to these models’ <em>agency</em>, or their capacity to act independently and purposefully.</p>,\n",
       " <p>One way to think of agents is as a natural next step after generative AI. Gen AI models focus on creating content based on learned patterns; agents use that content to interact with each other and other tools to make decisions, solve problems and complete tasks. For example, a gen AI app might be able to tell you the best time to climb Mt. Everest given your work schedule, but an agent can tell you this, and then use an online travel service to book you the best flight and reserve a room in the most convenient hotel in Nepal.</p>,\n",
       " <p>AI offers numerous benefits across various industries and applications. Some of the most commonly cited benefits include:</p>,\n",
       " <p>AI can automate routine, repetitive and often tedious tasks including digital tasks such as data collection, entering and preprocessing, and physical tasks such as warehouse stock-picking and manufacturing processes. This automation frees to work on higher value, more creative work.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Whether used for decision support or for fully automated decision-making, AI enables faster, more accurate predictions and reliable, <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/data-driven-decision-making\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">data-driven decisions</a>. Combined with automation, AI enables businesses to act on opportunities and respond to crises as they emerge, in real time and without human intervention.</p>,\n",
       " <p>AI can reduce human errors in various ways, from guiding people through the proper steps of a process, to flagging potential errors before they occur, and fully automating processes without human intervention. This is especially important in industries such as healthcare where, for example, AI-guided surgical robotics enable consistent precision.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Machine learning algorithms can continually improve their accuracy and further reduce errors as they're exposed to more data and \"learn\" from experience.</p>,\n",
       " <p>AI is always on, available around the clock, and delivers consistent performance every time. Tools such as AI chatbots or virtual assistants can lighten staffing demands for customer service or support. In other applications such as materials processing or production lines, AI can help maintain consistent work quality and output levels when used to complete repetitive or tedious tasks.</p>,\n",
       " <p>By automating dangerous work such as animal control, handling explosives, performing tasks in deep ocean water, high altitudes or in outer space, AI can eliminate the need to put human workers at risk of injury or worse. While they have yet to be perfected, self-driving cars and other vehicles offer the potential to reduce the risk of injury to passengers.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The real-world applications of AI are many. Here is just a small sampling of use cases across various industries to illustrate its potential:</p>,\n",
       " <p>Companies can implement AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants to handle customer inquiries, support tickets and more. These tools use <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing?\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">natural language processing</a> (NLP) and generative AI capabilities to understand and respond to customer questions about order status, product details and return policies.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Chatbots and virtual assistants enable always-on support, provide faster answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs), free human agents to focus on higher-level tasks, and give customers faster, more consistent service.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Machine learning and deep learning algorithms can analyze transaction patterns and flag anomalies, such as unusual spending or login locations, that indicate fraudulent transactions. This enables organizations to respond more quickly to potential fraud and limit its impact, giving themselves and customers greater peace of mind.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Retailers, banks and other customer-facing companies can use AI to create personalized customer experiences and marketing campaigns that delight customers, improve sales and prevent churn. Based on data from customer purchase history and behaviors, deep learning algorithms can recommend products and services customers are likely to want, and even generate personalized copy and special offers for individual customers in real time.</p>,\n",
       " <p>AI-driven recruitment platforms can streamline hiring by screening resumes, matching candidates with job descriptions, and even conducting preliminary interviews using video analysis. These and other tools can dramatically reduce the mountain of administrative paperwork associated with fielding a large volume of candidates. It can also reduce response times and time-to-hire, improving the experience for candidates whether they get the job or not.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Generative AI code generation tools and automation tools can streamline repetitive coding tasks associated with application development, and accelerate the migration and modernization (reformatting and replatorming) of legacy applications at scale. These tools can speed up tasks, help ensure code consistency and reduce errors.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Machine learning models can analyze data from sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) devices and operational technology (OT) to forecast when maintenance will be required and predict equipment failures before they occur. AI-powered preventive maintenance helps prevent downtime and enables you to stay ahead of supply chain issues before they affect the bottom line.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Organizations are scrambling to take advantage of the latest AI technologies and capitalize on AI's many benefits. This rapid adoption is necessary, but adopting and maintaining AI workflows comes with challenges and risks.</p>,\n",
       " <p>AI systems rely on <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/data-management\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">data sets</a> that might be vulnerable to data poisoning, data tampering, data bias or <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/cyber-attack\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">cyberattacks</a> that can lead to data breaches. Organizations can mitigate these risks by protecting <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/data-integrity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">data integrity</a> and implementing security and availability throughout the entire AI lifecycle, from development to training and deployment and postdeployment.</p>,\n",
       " <p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/threat-actor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">Threat actors</a> can target AI models for theft, reverse engineering or unauthorized manipulation. Attackers might compromise a model’s integrity by tampering with its architecture, weights or parameters; the core components that determine a model’s behavior, accuracy and performance.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Like all technologies, models are susceptible to <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/operational-risk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">operational risks</a> such as model drift, bias and breakdowns in the governance structure. Left unaddressed, these risks can lead to system failures and cybersecurity vulnerabilities that threat actors can use.</p>,\n",
       " <p>If organizations don’t prioritize safety and ethics when developing and deploying AI systems, they risk committing privacy violations and producing biased outcomes. For example, <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-bias\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">biased training data</a> used for hiring decisions might reinforce gender or racial stereotypes and create AI models that favor certain demographic groups over others.</p>,\n",
       " <p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-ethics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">AI ethics</a> is a multidisciplinary field that studies how to optimize AI's beneficial impact while reducing risks and adverse outcomes. Principles of AI ethics are applied through a system of <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-governance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">AI governance</a> consisted of guardrails that help ensure that AI tools and systems remain safe and ethical.</p>,\n",
       " <p>AI governance encompasses oversight mechanisms that address risks. An ethical approach to AI governance requires the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders, including developers, users, policymakers and ethicists, helping to ensure that AI-related systems are developed and used to align with society's values.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Here are common values associated with AI ethics and <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/responsible-ai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">responsible AI</a>:<br/>\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>As AI becomes more advanced, humans are challenged to comprehend and retrace how the algorithm came to a result. <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/explainable-ai?\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">Explainable AI</a> is a set of processes and methods that enables human users to interpret, comprehend and trust the results and output created by algorithms.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Although machine learning, by its very nature, is a form of statistical discrimination, the discrimination becomes objectionable when it places privileged groups at systematic advantage and certain unprivileged groups at systematic disadvantage, potentially causing varied harms. To encourage fairness, practitioners can try to minimize algorithmic bias across data collection and model design, and to build more diverse and inclusive teams.<br/>\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>Robust AI effectively handles exceptional conditions, such as abnormalities in input or malicious attacks, without causing unintentional harm. It is also built to withstand intentional and unintentional interference by protecting against exposed vulnerabilities.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Organizations should implement clear responsibilities and governance \n",
       " structures for the development, deployment and outcomes of AI systems. \n",
       " In addition, users should be able to see how an AI service works, \n",

       " limitations. Increased transparency provides information for AI \n",
       " consumers to better understand how the AI model or service was created. <br/>\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>Many regulatory frameworks, including GDPR, mandate that organizations abide by certain privacy principles when processing personal information.

       " <p>In order to contextualize the use of AI at various levels of complexity and sophistication, researchers have defined several types of AI that refer to its level of sophistication:</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Weak AI</strong>: Also known as “narrow AI,” defines AI systems designed to perform a specific task or a set of tasks. Examples might include “smart” voice assistant apps, such as Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, a social media chatbot or the autonomous vehicles promised by Tesla.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/strong-ai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">Strong AI</a></strong>: Also known as “artificial general intelligence” (AGI) or “general AI,” possess the ability to understand, learn and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level equal to or <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-superintelligence\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_self\">surpassing human intelligence</a>. This level of AI is currently theoretical and no known AI systems approach this level of sophistication. Researchers argue that if AGI is even possible, it requires major increases in computing power. Despite recent advances in AI development, self-aware AI systems of science fiction remain firmly in that realm.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The idea of \"a machine that thinks\" dates back to ancient Greece. But since the advent of electronic computing (and relative to some of the topics discussed in this article) important events and milestones in the evolution of AI include the following:</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>1950</strong><br/>\n",
       " Alan Turing publishes <a href=\"https://courses.cs.umbc.edu/471/papers/turing.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"ibm_icon_launch_external_after\">Computing Machinery and Intelligence</span></a>.
